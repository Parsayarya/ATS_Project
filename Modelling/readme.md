Installation
The project is contained in a Jupyter Notebook file named FinalTopicModelling.ipynb. To run this file, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

Install the latest version of Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda distribution is recommended for ease of use).
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the FinalTopicModelling.ipynb file.
Navigate to the directory containing FinalTopicModelling.ipynb in your terminal.
Run jupyter notebook to start the Jupyter Notebook app.
## Usage
Open the FinalTopicModelling.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to understand the steps involved in the Topic Modelling process.
You can execute the cells to see the output or modify the code to suit your data and requirements.
## Code Explanation
The FinalTopicModelling.ipynb notebook employs two major models for topic modelling:

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):
LDA is a probabilistic model that assumes topics are probability distributions over words and documents are mixtures of topics.
It uses a generative process where each document is assumed to be generated by a mixture of a small number of topics.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):
NMF is a linear algebraic model that factors high-dimensional vectors into a low-dimensionality representation.
Unlike LDA, NMF does not assume a probabilistic generative process but seeks to find latent variables by approximating the reconstruction of the original data.
The notebook guides you through the process of preparing the data, building the models, and visualizing the topics. Each section of the code is well-commented, providing insights into the steps involved in the analysis.
